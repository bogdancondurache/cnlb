`text` folder contains everything needed for the text sentiment analysis and `vision` is for object detection

The source code is pretty similar for both of them, so I focused mostly on the `text` one, that one is also done as a web application and also has Docker support.
Most of the source code comments are in the `text` project so please check that one if you want to understand the code, the `vision` project has comments for the things
that are different.
